    <center><h3>What is Gender Inequality?</h3></center>

        <p> According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, inequality is: “the quality of being unequal or uneven, such as: social disparity; disparity of distribution or opportunity.” </p>
        <p> What does this mean and how does it relate to gender? As Inequality.org reports, “Women are scarce at the top and underrepresented at the bottom.” This is proven by the multitude of research studies that have yielded the same result: women are being discriminated against in many aspects of life, including education, health, and lifestyle. Even with all the progress that’s been made to reduce the gap of opportunities offered to men and to women, gender bias is still prevalent in homes, schools, and workplaces. A prime example is the wage divide, where women earn nearly 40% less than men on average globally. Together, by educating and advocating, we can all work to close the gender gap. </p> </h4 ></center>
