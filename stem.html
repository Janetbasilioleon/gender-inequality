        <p> - Female students are more likely than male students to enroll in lab science courses (22% vs. 18%) </p>
        <p> - Male students are more likely than female students to enroll in computer science courses (81% vs. 19%) </p>
        <p> - In 2012, women earned less than 12% of each science and engineering degree: </p>
        <p> 11.2% of bachelor’s degrees </p>
        <p> 8.2% of master’s degrees </p>
        <p> 4.1% of doctorate degrees </p>
        <p> - In 2016, women earned 50.3% of all STEM-related bachelor’s degrees but only accounted for 29% of the STEM workforce </p>
        <p> - Women make up less than 36% of each STEM occupation: </p>
        <p> 35.2% of chemists were women </p>
        <p> 10.7% of computer engineers were women </p>
        <p> 7.9% of mechanical engineers were women </p>
        <p> - A 2018 study by New York University discovered that not as many women choose to major in STEM fields not because more math or science is required, but because of the “gender discrimination they are likely to encounter in those fields” </p>

        <p> “The data does not support the notion that women are math-phobic or science-phobic, as some believe. Rather-and quite reasonably-women don't like to be discriminated against” -Joseph Cimpian, Ph.D., senior author of NYU study </p>
